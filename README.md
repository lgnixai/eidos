    Eidos is an extensible framework for managing your personal data throughout your lifetime in one place.
    </p>
</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Eidos sets a big goal in mind, but it is still in its early stages, and there is a lot of work to be done. You can give it a try, but I do not recommend using it for production purposes. If you're interested in this project, I recommend staying updated on its development. If you have an Early Access key, you'll receive an email notification when Eidos is officially released.

## Features

- Out-of-the-box Notion-like documents and databases
- Offline Support: Everything runs inside your local machine. Access your data without an internet connection. Data is stored locally for blazing-fast performance.
- AI Features: Deeply integrated with LLM for AI-powered capabilities. Translate, summarize, and interact with your data within Eidos.
- Extensible: Customize Eidos to suit your needs. Write extension code manually or use AI to generate extension code

  - Micro block: UI components for customized data display and interaction. Can be referenced in documents, covers, and right panels
  - Doc Plugin: Customize document editor behavior
  - Script: Create powerful data processing logic with TypeScript/JavaScript/Python.
  - UDF: Use JavaScript to create custom calculation functions for use in table Formula fields.

- Developer Friendly:

  - API & SDK
  - Sqlite Standardization: Every table in Eidos is a SQLite table.

## How to use

> [!WARNING]
> Web app is deprecated, use desktop app instead.

There are two versions of Eidos:

- Web app[tech preview]: Accessible via browser, it's a pure PWA with no web server. But it has some limitations, see [web-vs-desktop](./docs/web-vs-desktop.md)
- Desktop app[recommended]: Offline support, full features.
